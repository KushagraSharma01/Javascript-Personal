# DOM (Document Object Model)    -->
        Document --> HTML   
        Object   --> Js Object
        Model    --> Modelling or Manipulating (to change)

**This means we can change our HTML with the help of Js

So we do'nt need to go inside the HTML to change it, we can use Js for that

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Browser 
    Browser provides us an object which is called "document"

**when we type "document" on the console of browser, it gives us the complete
HTML code for the webpage (more specifically it gives the "DOM tree" of the webpage)

DOM tree -->    (refer to notebook for more clear diagram)
        HTML -->
            head --> 
                link
                title
                meta

            body -->
                section
                p tag
                div
                ul tag -->
                    li tag
                etc..

the entire HTML is converted into an object called "document"
on the browser 

Now in order to change or manipulate the html we should know which element
or part of the html page should be changed or manipulated

This can be done by using different "Selectors"

Selectors :-
    1. getElementByTagName --> by selecting the element with it's tag name
    2. getElementById  --> by giving id to the element (as we used to do for applying css)
    3. getElementByClass --> by selecting the element with it's class name
    4. querySelector --> selects only one element
    5. querySelectorAll --> selects all elements according to the query
